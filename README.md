# Credits
The base game is from the tutorial [JavaScript Broughlike Tutorial](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/index.html) from [Jeremiah Reid](https://github.com/nluqo). After that I added many features and changed many things to create an version with many selfmade additions.

All sprites where drawn by  myself.
