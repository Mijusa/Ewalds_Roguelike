# About the Game
This game was made for an University Project. The goal was to create a game with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I decided to create a Roguelike game, because I like the genre and I wanted to try to create one.

# Credits
The base game is from the tutorial [JavaScript Broughlike Tutorial](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/index.html) made by [Jeremiah Reid](https://github.com/nluqo). After following the tutorialt i added many features and changed many things to create my own Roguelike.

## Art / Sprites
All sprites where drawn by  myself in 16 x 16 bit on the App [Pixaki](https://pixaki.com/) and then addited together with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

## Music
The Music is from [pixaby][https://pixabay.com/]. I only chose free to use and royalty free SFX and edited them a bit with [Audacity](https://www.audacity.de/).

## AI
Some of the code was written with the help of ChatGPT or Github Copilot, because im new to JavaScript.
